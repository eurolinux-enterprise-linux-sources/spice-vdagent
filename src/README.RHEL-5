spice-vdagent and RHEL-5 README
-------------------------------

spice-vdagent can also be used inside RHEL-5 guests, if, and only if, they
are hosted on a host which uses virtio-serial as the agent channel. Note
that older hosts, such as qemu shipped with RHEL-5 for example, use
a custom pci device (the spicevmc device) for the agent channel and
there is no Linux support for this device so spice-vdagent does not work
inside guests hosted on such hosts! Hosts based on RHEL-6 or Fedora 15
and newer for example, are fine.

spice-vdagent relies on ConsoleKit to determine the active session, since
RHEL-5 has no ConsoleKit it cannot do this on RHEL-5, therefor only 1
active X-session is supported with RHEL-5. If you try to start multiple
sessions by running multiple X-servers the agent will disable itself.

Since the RHEL-5 X-server does not support hotplugging of input devices,
spice-vdagentd must be started before the X-server, so that it can create
the uinput tablet device it uses for agent mouse mode.

This also means that you must use a customized xorg.conf to teach the
X-server about the uinput device. An example xorg.conf is included with
spice-vdagent. After installing spice-vdagent, first start spice-vdagentd,
and then copy this file to /etc/X11/xorg.conf and restart your X-server.

Note: the sample xorg.conf assumes that the vm has been configured to *not*
use a usb tablet device, since there is no need for one with the agent and
usb emulation takes a significant amount of CPU.

Building from source for RHEL-5
-------------------------------

If you're building spice-vdagent from source on RHEL-5, you must pass
--disable-console-kit --enable-static-uinput to ./configure!

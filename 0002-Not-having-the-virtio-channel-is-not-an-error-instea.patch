Subject: [PATCH 2/4] Not having the virtio channel is not an error; instead silently do nothing

Fedora for example bundles the SPICE agent by default; however, we
don't want to spew an error when running non-virtualized, or with
plain VNC.

Let's just silently exit; while we could change LOG_ERR -> LOG_INFO
or something, that's still pointless noise in most people's syslog.

Someone who was debugging a misconfigured SPICE setup would pretty
quickly notice that they were missing the virtio port.

(This patch is part of a larger initiative to reduce error
 spew on default startup in common deployment scenarios such as
 KVM+VNC.)
